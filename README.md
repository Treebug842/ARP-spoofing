# ARP-spoofing
A linux script to automatically arp spoof a device and gain a man in the middle position. Simply run the script and it will try and detect what subnet you are on (only supports 192.168.0.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 so far) and will then scan that subnet for devices. You can the pick a target from that list of devices and the script will start sending arp spoof packets to gain a man in the middle position XD
